The core props of this mod
Unlocked at the beginning, built in the cooking blueprint
You can add 4 items to Advanced Stove, then click Advanced Cooking
If the recipe is correct, raw materials are consumed and cooking is produced
If the recipe is incorrect, the raw materials will not be consumed and the output will fail
4. The current formula is as follows:
Aloe Vera Gazpacho = Ice | Ice | Aloe Vera Leaf | Aloe Vera Leaf
meatballs = any|meat|meat|meat
meatballs = any|any|meat|meat
Fluffy Potato Souffle = Any | Potatoes | Potatoes | Eggs
Fresh Fruit Crepes = Fruit|Fruit|Sugar|Flour
Seafood chowder = water|onion|tomato|fish
Any item that does not have a relevant cooking label, such as a small branch, but not a scarlet carp
5. Now you can customize the recipe through MoonFood-Ex.txt in the folder!
Example: Guil - Xiaoyue Food_馨香鱼汤#795bb63c97c04cd3be1743e2dbc768fd#香香鱼汤#A kind of dish made with fish, coconut, water, and green onions. It’s quite delicious#鱼|肉汤|水|#40， 12, 40, -10, 12, 12#2#192
Format: card internal name#Guid (can be generated by pressing F6 in the technology first)#card name#card description#ingredients list (liquid dosage is fixed at 300)#card consumption effect, if there is no place, please write if it is not at the end 0 occupancy (full food, stomach, water, stress, emotion, world view, ice food, sunburn, burn, hot food) #可装料数据#Decomposition time (unit: TP)
The ingredient tag label refers to the form specified by crom, and the flower has not been added yet
The ingredients can be matched sequentially in the following 3 ways:
NameMatch(Aloe Gazpacho = Ice | Ice | Aloe Leaf | Aloe Leaf) (recommended)
Mix and match (seafood chowder=water|onion|tomato|fish) (deprecated, currently only fish, meat, water are supported)
tagmatch(meatballs=any|any|meat|meat) (recommended)

Please make sure that there is a corresponding picture file under the Resource\Picture folder. The picture file format must be png, for example (coconut fish soup.png), otherwise an error will be reported when opening the game.

The advanced alchemy table adds the function of container merging
For example, put 4 plastic bottles to get a level 4 container (hold 4 parts water)
The liquid in the original container will not be retained, so remember to empty it before putting it in
Container up to level 20

The rest of the attributes of the container are the same as the small clay pot
